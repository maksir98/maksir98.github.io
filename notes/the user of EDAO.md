# The Users of EDAO

The idea of EDAO came up when I watched a video about full stack web3 development in accident. From that time I began to see web3 seriously.I felt maybe we can utilize web3 to do great things though I didn't even know how the things would look like. I have this thought for serveral reasons: 1. Nowaday many social platforms have full control of content created by users. Platforms will delete or block some content not because users didn't like it but it harms some organization's interets; 2. The code and data on chain will remain as long as the chain lives, which means even the project is not maintained anymore their data will not lost. So for developers, the web3 projects are cheaper to maintain; 3. web3 is like a virtual world and all applications on it are linked together and it is hard for web2 applications to do it. The word "link" means each applications can utilize others' data and logic and application needn't rebuild system like login or payment.
