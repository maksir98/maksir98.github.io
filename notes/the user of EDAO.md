# The Users of EDAO

The key that determine whether EDAO will grow is whether users need it.

The idea of EDAO came up when I watched a video about full stack web3 development in accident. From that time I began to see web3 seriously.I felt maybe we can utilize web3 to do great things though I didn't even know how the things would look like.

I have this thought for serveral reasons: 

1. Nowaday many social platforms have full control of content created by users. Platforms will delete or block some content not because users didn't like it but it harms some organization's interets. But Web3 can guarantee that once the data is loaded on chains, it is recorded forever. There is no way can actually wipe the data out. 
2. The code and data on chain will remain as long as the chain lives, which means even the project is not maintained anymore the application will not lost. So for developers, web3 projects may cheaper to be maintained. And for users who view their data as important assets, it is a good place to hold their data.
3. The code behind web3 applications is transparent. It means everyone knows how their data can be handled and all history of operations happened to the data. There is no cheating.

When we talk about users need something, it doesn't merely mean they have problems unsolved. One of advantage of market economy is that if people both know their needs and able to satisfy it, they already would be.[1]
So if I plan to start a project, it should either find a new way to solve existing problems or explore new need.
