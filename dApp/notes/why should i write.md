# Why Should I Write

  I began feel like I should write down something when I plan to build something interesting, i.e EpitaphDAO. It is because the process of writing can make my massive idea clear. If my idea can't be written down, that means I haven't had a right image of it. 

  My writing should be simple, just like talking to friends. If I can't explain my idea with spoken language, which would be more acceptable to readers, it is a sign that I haven't master that idea yet. According to my experience of learning programming, everything can be explained clearly without obscure terminologies no matter how complex the topic is. If the reader is a newcomer who has little knowledge of the topic, what writer should do is to have a more well thought introduction that gives the reader a clear image of writer's core idea.

  Another advantage of writing simply is it can stick my readers. Using onscure terminologies or fancy sentences may seems cool to writers. But if readers can't understand the meaning, it just a waste of time to them and they will leave. During my work experience in Tech Company, explain ideas simply and clearly can make colleages like you.
